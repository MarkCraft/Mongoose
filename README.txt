This is a "red team" tool designed to perfrom a SYN flood DDoS attack.
The tool can be run in either random mode or precise mode. 
Random mode will spoof a random IP address to send the SYN packets to the target machine
Precise mode will require an additional input for the source address. This mode can help you bypass firewall rules based on IP addresses/range of IP addresses.

Use this tool with extreme caution
